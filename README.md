# Sign Language to Text Using CNN

A deep learning project designed to translate sign language gestures into text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This tool aims to bridge communication barriers for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

## Features
- Recognizes and translates hand gestures into corresponding text.
- Utilizes a robust CNN architecture for high accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- Suitable for educational, professional, and personal use.

## Dataset
This project uses a custom dataset of sign language images. You can download the dataset [here](#) (add dataset link).

### Dataset Details
- Classes: Alphabets
- Format: Images in `.jpg` or `.png` format.
- Preprocessing: Images resized to a fixed size (e.g., 64x64).

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project includes:
- **Input Layer:** Preprocessed image data.
- **Hidden Layers:** Convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers.
- **Output Layer:** Fully connected layer with softmax activation.

### Training
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

## Usage
1. Place your input images (hand gestures) in the `input` directory.
2. Run the script and view predictions in the terminal or GUI:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
3. Predictions will be saved to the `output` directory.
